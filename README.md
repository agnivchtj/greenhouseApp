# Greenhouse App

This project involved setting up a REST API to perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations on mock greenhouse data. The data contains entries on environment & soil conditions as well as numbers pertaining to tomato production & harvest. The tech stack consists of React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for backend server code, Mongoose to model data and MongoDB database to store the data in document-based format. The API makes use of HTTP messages to query the web server and retrieve json data from the database; the user interface/ frontend calls the API and the data retrieved is displayed in a tabular format for users with the feature to update entries or add new ones to the existing collections.
